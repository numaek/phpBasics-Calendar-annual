# phpBasics-Calendar-annual

```
An annual calendar to include for your homepage.

Weekdays, calendar weeks, today's day and month are shown in color.
The start of the week can be changed to Monday or Saturday.


The scripts of the php-Basics series require rudimentary knowledge in dealing with variables and program sequences.
They serve the purpose of doing something with your newly acquired basic knowledge of PHP.
It should only be application examples for inspiration, which can be expanded further.

Most of the explanations for the individual steps can be found in the source code.
